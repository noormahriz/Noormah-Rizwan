## Noormah Rizwan

Welcome! I am an applied economist with research interests focusing on environmental, agricultural and behavioral economics.\
I have over 6 years of experience in conducting empirical research on climate adaptation, water scarcity, and economic development that aims to address policy-relevant issues.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural, Food and Resource Economics at Michigan State University. My expected graduation is in May 2026.

Previously, I have worked as a Research Analyst at the International Food Policy Research Institute. I have also interned at United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific.

I have expertise in applied microeconometrics, spatial data analysis, and econometric modeling, including discrete choice and structural models. I also have significant experience in producing policy-relevant research, engaging stakeholders, and presenting findings to diverse audiences.
